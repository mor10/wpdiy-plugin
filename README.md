# WPDIY Plugin

The WPDIY plugin. Probably not something you're interested in.

This plugin adds the persistent header with disclaimer info and a link to the WPDIY lander page in WPDIY course demo sites. 

Unless you are Carrie or Morten you probably have zero interest in this. If you're curious go check out http://wpdiy.net

Contributions welcome. This plugin is a mess.
